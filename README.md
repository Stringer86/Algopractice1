# Q1-Warmups

<!-- I have split out Q1-warmups to create browser based tests. The reason for moving away from node.js mocha testing for Q1 is to avoid the introduction of node.js until Q2 (specifically the usage of modules.export). If this is a good pattern, I'll see about getting it merged into the official warmup repository -->


# How To:

### To start:

Fork this repo, then clone your fork. 

```bash
git clone <git url for your fork of the repository>
```

Changed directory into the repository

```bash
cd Q1-Warmups
```

Then, set the remote 'upstream' to the gSchool repo:

```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/gSchool/Q1-Warmups.git
```

### Every day:

First: get the new code from the upstream:

```
git pull upstream master
```

Second: Work on the warmup for the day. Check the daily plan for a link. Run tests by opening the HTML file.




Third: when you've completed the warmup (or at 10:00) push your work to your fork!
